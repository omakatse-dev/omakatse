            Omakatse&apos;s founder, Tee, is a second generation immigrant that
            grew up in Canada.
          </h3>
          <p className="bodyMD">
            While growing up with her family&apos;s restaurant, an abandoned
            black cat started visiting them daily. As the family was leaving on
            the last day of the restaurant, the same black cat chased them down
            the street. Seeing this, the family took her in, joining the family
            dog, Casper, and that began a journey into cat rescuing for Tee that
            is still going on 20 years later today. The black cat had four
            children, two of which are still alive and well back in Canada at
            the ripe age of 20. They were later joined by the family&apos;s
            second dog, Oscar.

            Throughout her student and adult life, Tee would volunteer at local
            animal shelters in Canada. She is also an avid equestrian, while
            being a big supporter of equine and farm animal welfare in North
            America.

            <br />
            She relocated to Dubai with her Canadian tuxedo cat, Toby. On a
            chance encounter in Dubai, she rescued her now Arabian Mau family
            member, Olly, nursing him back to health. Since then, she has been
            an active community member supporting cat welfare and rescues, while
            also personally helping out around her local community with feeding,
            trap & release, fostering and rescue work.

            With Omakatse, Tee endeavours to introduce holistic pet products
            from Japan that she has been using all these years as a paw-rent.

            During extensive stays in Japan due to work, she would always
            appreciate the large varieties of Japanese pet products and
            accessories. With numerous local brands developing ranges of
            products with a story and motivation, it demonstrates the Japanese
            culture of taking pet ownership seriously. To satisfy the demands of
            pet owners in Japan, high quality ingredient lists are provided,
            with a focus on natural and minimal additives. By curating products
            directly from Japan, Tee hopes to spread this philosophy in the UAE.
