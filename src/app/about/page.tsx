                Omakatse&apos;s founder, Tee, is a second generation immigrant
                that grew up in Canada.
              </h3>
              <p className="bodyMD text-gray-800">
                While growing up with her family&apos;s restaurant, an abandoned
                primary cat started visiting them daily. As the family was
                leaving on the last day of the restaurant, the same primary cat
                chased them down the street. Seeing this, the family took her
                in, joining the family dog, Casper, and that began a journey
                into cat rescuing for Tee that is still going on 20 years later
                today. The primary cat had four children, two of which are still
                alive and well back in Canada at the ripe age of 20. They were
                later joined by the family&apos;s second dog, Oscar.

              <p className="bodyMD text-gray-800">
                Throughout her student and adult life, Tee would volunteer at
                local animal shelters in Canada. She is also an avid equestrian,
                while being a big supporter of equine and farm animal welfare in
                North America.
                <br />
                <br />
                She relocated to Dubai with her Canadian tuxedo cat, Toby. On a
                chance encounter in Dubai, she rescued her now Arabian Mau
                family member, Olly, nursing him back to health. Since then, she
                has been an active community member supporting cat welfare and
                rescues, while also personally helping out around her local
                community with feeding, trap & release, fostering and rescue
                work.

                {' '}
                With Omakatse, Tee endeavours to introduce holistic pet products
                from Japan that she has been using all these years as a
                paw-rent.
              </h3>
              <p className="bodyMD text-gray-800">
                During extensive stays in Japan due to work, she would always
                appreciate the large varieties of Japanese pet products and
                accessories. With numerous local brands developing ranges of
                products with a story and motivation, it demonstrates the
                Japanese culture of taking pet ownership seriously. To satisfy
                the demands of pet owners in Japan, high quality ingredient
                lists are provided, with a focus on natural and minimal
                additives. By curating products directly from Japan, Tee hopes
                to spread this philosophy in the UAE.
